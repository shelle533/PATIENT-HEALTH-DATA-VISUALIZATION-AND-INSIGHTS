# PATIENT-HEALTH-DATA-VISUALIZATION-AND-INSIGHTS
A Power BI dashboard project that visualizes patient health data, including age, diagnoses, comorbidities, and follow-up care. It highlights key insights to improve healthcare decisions, identify care gaps, and enhance treatment outcomes through data analysis.
## In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing essential patient details such as ID, age, gender, primary diagnosis, comorbidities, length of stay, discharge destination, follow-up appointments, medication adherence, and care satisfaction.

The aim was to extract actionable insights from the data using visual analytics to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions. I used Power BI to build an interactive dashboard for this purpose
## I also used power query to do some data wrangling and cleaning (handling missing values and inconsistencies)

## üîç Why This Project Matters
Visualizing patient data is crucial because it helps healthcare workers and decision-makers:

Quickly identify trends or red flags in patient care,

Track treatment outcomes over time,

Understand where post-discharge interventions are needed,

And make data-driven decisions for better health outcomes and resource allocation.

Instead of going through thousands of rows of patient records, visual dashboards make these insights available at a glance.
