# PATIENT-HEALTH-DATA-VISUALIZATION-AND-INSIGHTS
A Power BI dashboard project that visualizes patient health data, including age, diagnoses, comorbidities, and follow-up care. It highlights key insights to improve healthcare decisions, identify care gaps, and enhance treatment outcomes through data analysis.
## In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing essential patient details such as ID, age, gender, primary diagnosis, comorbidities, length of stay, discharge destination, follow-up appointments, medication adherence, and care satisfaction.

The aim was to extract actionable insights from the data using visual analytics to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions. I used Power BI to build an interactive dashboard for this purpose
## I also used power query to do some data wrangling and cleaning (handling missing values and inconsistencies)

## üîç Why This Project Matters
Visualizing patient data is crucial because it helps healthcare workers and decision-makers:

Quickly identify trends or red flags in patient care,

Track treatment outcomes over time,

Understand where post-discharge interventions are needed,

And make data-driven decisions for better health outcomes and resource allocation.

Instead of going through thousands of rows of patient records, visual dashboards make these insights available at a glance.

## üìä Key Insights from My Dashboard:
Average Length of Stay: Patients spend an average of 16 days in care.

Average Age: Patients are mostly older, with a mean age of 53.87 years.

Patient Load: 10,000 patients were analyzed, with an average of 1.5 comorbidities per person, totaling over 15,000 comorbidities.

Gendered Diagnoses:

Males presented more with injuries and respiratory problems,

Females showed a higher rate of diabetes, possibly linked to glucose metabolism differences.

Follow-Up Appointments: A large number of patients do not return for follow-up, revealing a gap in continuity of care.

Discharge Destinations: Most patients were discharged to rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, or home, but the need for follow-up remains significant.

Medication Adherence: Though tracked, it needs deeper exploration to fully understand treatment compliance.

Overall, this data highlights a complex patient population with high care demands and low follow-up engagement, signaling areas where hospitals and health agencies can improve patient outcomes.

## üé® Design Choices:
I used navy blue as the dominant color in the dashboard, which is calm and widely used in the medical field for clarity and professionalism.
I also ensured that charts like bar charts and line graphs were used for simplicity and fast comprehension by stakeholders.
